# 📝 To-Do List Manager

A simple, database-driven To-Do List Management System built with **Python** and **MySQL**.  
This project demonstrates how to integrate Python with MySQL to create a task management application where users can add, view, and delete tasks securely.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
In daily life, people often forget important tasks due to poor organization. Manual methods like notebooks or memory are inefficient and unreliable.  
This project solves the problem by providing a structured system to manage tasks digitally, ensuring better productivity and data persistence.

---

## 🎯 Aim
To design and develop a **To-Do List Management System** using MySQL that helps users efficiently manage their daily tasks with secure storage and retrieval.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create a database-driven To-Do List application using MySQL.  
- Implement a login system with **admin** and **member** roles.  
- Allow admins to add, view, and delete tasks.  
- Allow members to view tasks only.  
- Ensure data persistence with proper database operations.  
- Improve productivity by organizing tasks digitally.  
- Enhance understanding of basic SQL operations: `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `DELETE`.

---

## 📂 Data Source
User-entered task data stored in MySQL, including:
- Task ID  
- Task Name  
- Completion Date  
- Action Time  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Connector:** mysql-connector-python  
- **SQL Operations:** INSERT, SELECT, DELETE  
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Operating System:** Windows  

---

## ⚙️ System Overview
The application interacts with a MySQL database to manage tasks:
- **Admin Role:** Add, view, and delete tasks.  
- **Member Role:** View tasks only.  
- **Data Persistence:** All tasks remain stored in the database even after closing the application.  

---

## 🚀 Methodology / Working Steps
1. User starts the application.  
2. System connects to the MySQL database.  
3. Login credentials are requested.  
   - **Admin:** Full access (Add, View, Delete).  
   - **Member:** Limited access (View only).  
4. Tasks are managed through SQL operations.  
5. Changes are committed to ensure persistence.  
6. Application runs until the user exits.

## 🌟 Key Features
- Add new tasks easily  
- View all saved tasks  
- Delete completed/unnecessary tasks  
- Secure database storage  
- Simple and user-friendly interface  

---

## 📊 Findings & Insights
- **Task Organization:** Digital storage reduces confusion and missed deadlines.  
- **Productivity:** Regular tracking improves daily efficiency.  
- **Data Persistence:** MySQL ensures reliability and long-term storage.  
- **Ease of Use:** Faster than manual methods.  
- **Error Reduction:** Minimizes duplication and loss of information.
